Javascript  Accuracy  - Javascript code is running properly and computes the correct results

Styling and Layout - Font Styles, Button Styles, Div Positions or Layouts, Alignment of Inputs, text and numbers.  Integer Inputs and Displays should be right aligned at 0 decimal laces. Currency Inputs and Displays should be right aligned at 2 decimal places.

Use of Modals - User confirmation i.e. deleting of records, clearing of rows should be done using dialog modals instead of javascript confirms.  Try the version 5 of shopping cart at https://jrageralde.github.io/ITC/ShoppingCart5.html. Try adding several items and deleting an item then clearing the cart.  View the page source and study the code on use of dialogs as modals.  

**Note: Your Prefinals Grade will be computed by getting 50% of your Circuitverse Project and 50% from your individual web page project
